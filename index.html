      Going to university isnâ€™t
        just about getting a degree, there is
        an entire lifestyle that comes with being a
        student. Studying is a big part of the
        experience, but there are also many
        opportunities available which will allow
        you to try new things, meet new people,
        and make the most of your free time.

            Set between the rivers Don and Dee in the North-East of Scotland,
            Aberdeen is one of the top 10 places to live and work in the UK, according
            to The Good Growth for Cities Index run by PwC.

            after hearing Louella screech down the phone like a 'wild animal'.

            By the time Mr Michie and Mrs Fletcher arrived at the site in Lulworth, Dorset, their daughter had died - just an hour before her 25th birthday.
            Today, giving evidence for the first time, Mr Michie broke down in tears as he told Winchester C
            rown Court how he begged security staff to let him through the gates as his daughter lay dying inside.
            The jury heard how her family were eating Sunday dinner in their London home when they received a
            call from Broughton in which Louella could be heard.
            Mr Michie said: 'The thing that I most remember was that Louella seemed very distressed.
            I could hear her in the background shouting things like 'I hate you, I don't trust you',
            obviously referring to Ceon.'
            He told her alleged killer: 'I don't know how you can say you love someone who you left to die in front of you.'
            He said he initially defended Broughton and 'believed him to be a good person at the time.'
            But he said he had not realised 'how he had not taken her to get help, how he had seen her in a very, very distressed
            state and possibly even filmed her after she has died'.
            Mr Michie said Broughton dismissed his daughter for overreacting as she was dying. He added: 'I've since learnt he described
            her as a drama queen, which is hurtful.'
            Broughton, from Enfield, London, denies manslaughter and supplying a class A drug.
